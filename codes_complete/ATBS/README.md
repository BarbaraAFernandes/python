# Automate the boring Stuff folder

Based on a book:
[Automate The Boring Stuff With Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)

Just for training purposes, thanks to **Al Sweigart** for this great book and for the help on twitter.

Some of the codes were changed to serve in my own reality, and are not _revised_ or _endorsed_ by the author.
